> **Abstract:** *In the pursuit of achieving ever-increasing accuracy, large and complex neural networks are usually developed. Such models demand high computational resources and therefore cannot be deployed on edge devices. It is of great interest to build resource-efficient general purpose networks due to their usefulness in several application areas. In this work, we strive to effectively combine the strengths of both CNN and Transformer models and propose a new efficient hybrid architecture EdgeNeXt. Specifically in EdgeNeXt, we introduce split depth-wise transpose attention (SDTA) encoder that splits input tensors into multiple channel groups and utilizes depth-wise convolution along with self-attention across channel dimensions to implicitly increase the receptive field and encode multi-scale features. Our extensive experiments on classification, detection and segmentation tasks, reveal the merits of the proposed approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with comparatively lower compute requirements. Our EdgeNeXt model with 1.3M parameters achieves 71.2\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, outperforming MobileViT with an absolute gain of 2.2\% with 28\% reduction in FLOPs. Further, our EdgeNeXt model with 5.6M parameters achieves 79.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K.*

## Installation
1. Create conda environment
```shell
conda create --name edgenext python=3.8
conda activate edgenext
```
2. Install PyTorch and torchvision
```shell
pip install torch torchvision --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```
3. Install other dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<hr />

## Dataset Preparation
Download the [ImageNet-1K](http://image-net.org/) classification dataset and structure the data as follows:
```
/path/to/imagenet-1k/
  train/
    class1/
      img1.jpeg
    class2/
      img2.jpeg
  val/
    class1/
      img3.jpeg
    class2/
      img4.jpeg
```

<hr />

## Evaluation
Download the pretrained weights and run the following command for evaluation on ImageNet-1K dataset.

```shell
wget https://github.com/mmaaz60/EdgeNeXt/releases/download/v1.0/edgenext_small.pth
python main.py --model edgenext_small --eval True --batch_size 16 --data_path <path to imagenet> --output_dir <results> --resume edgenext_small.pth
```
This should give,
```text
Acc@1 79.412 Acc@5 94.512 loss 0.881
```

##### Note: For evaluating the USI model, please set `usi_eval True`.

<hr />
