Implement the code from the [Paper](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf), all the architecture and parameters are the same as paper, the only different thing is that I trained the model with only 100 classes, because 1000 classes might take too much time. 

The accuracy and loss are shown as below:

The results of the feature visualization are shown as below:
